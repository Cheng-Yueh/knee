# Mechanical assembly
The prescribed assembly is available as Parasolid format (LEG_ASSY_2_PUBLIC.x_t). Construction order should be quite self-explanatory; there is no single best method, which lends to modular flexibility. In general:
*	Prepare ALL electronics and wiring in advance.
*	Build the knee joint from inside core to the outside.
*	Use various strength threadlocker (or none at all) in lieu of nyloc nuts.
*	Cable conduits and holes throughout the CAD model facilitate different wiring combinations depending on application. Use them wisely.

## FDM suggestions
Field deposition modeling (FDM) for 3D printing plastic parts presented in this product is preferred. Ultraviolet stereolithography (SLA) methods are not advised due to poor structural strength. 30% infill using polylactic acid (PLA) should be more than adequate for most parts. Consider up to 60% infill for knee pivot components experiencing concentrated stresses.

## Lubrication
All transmission components should be lubricated with elastomer-polytetrafluoroethylene gelling agent and parafiinic mineral base oils. These grease compounds do not react with FDM plastics such as PLA, facilitating stable and low maintenance operation.
